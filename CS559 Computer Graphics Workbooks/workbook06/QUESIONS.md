## Questions for Workbook 6

Because the exam is coming up, we won't bother asking you many questions here - we'll ask you lots of questions soon enough.

However we want to know:

## What editor did you use for doing this assignment?

## If you used Visual Studio Code, did the TypeScript checking (as discussed on Page 1) work for you?
