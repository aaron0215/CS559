<h1>Workbook 2, Page 1: Web Graphics APIs</h1>
<p>First things first, the "kind" of graphics we will be doing is 
"object-based" or "vector" or "primitive-based" graphics, as opposed
to "image-based" graphics. 
Read the <a href="http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/cs559-fall2014/2014/08/29/image-based-graphics-vs-object-based-graphics/">Tutorial: Image vs. Object (raster vs. vector)</a>.
The tutorial is from 2014, but it still applies 
(except that in class, we won't be doing much image-based graphics).</p>
<p>For most of this class, we will be doing non-image-based graphics. 
The other category is harder to name (I used the term "object-based"),
but the basic idea is that we create pictures not by describing the color
of each pixel (as image-based graphics would do), but rather by using
a set of "primitives" (basic objects) that we put together to make pictures.</p>
<p>For doing (2D) graphics on web pages, there are two main APIs: <em>Canvas</em> and <em>SVG</em>.
In class, we'll mainly be using Canvas, but we will look at SVG as well.
For the purposes of this workbook, SVG is important because it represents a
very different kind of API than Canvas. They both do similar things, 
but they do it in very different ways.</p>
<p>The distinction I'd like to make in graphics APIs is <em>immediate</em> vs. <em>retained</em> mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Immediate</strong> mode APIs draw immediately. When you make a function call to create, for example, a rectangle, the rectangle gets drawn immediately. The system colors the pixels right away. In practice, you may not see the changes immediately (more on that in a bit). But, when you make a drawing call (like to the rectangle function), conceptually, the system colors the pixels. It forgets why it colored the pixels after its done doing it. <strong>Canvas</strong> is an immediate mode API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retained</strong> mode APIs create a list of objects that are drawn on demand. Function calls create objects in some storage (e.g., a list of objects), and eventually this list is drawn. The system remembers the objects, and refers to these when coloring the pixels. <strong>SVG</strong> is a retained mode API. Retained mode APIs are sometimes called <em>display-list</em> APIs since they keep a list of things to display.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This distinction will become clearer as we work through some examples. </p>

        <h2>Box 1: Graphics Elements</h2>
        <p>
        Web pages are made up of elements - like paragraphs, headings, and buttons.
        To do graphics, we make special elements that give us a rectangular region that
        we can draw in.
        For the Canvas API (and actually some other APIs), we create "canvas" elements
        using the "canvas" tag.
        For SVGs, we create "svg" elements using the SVG tag.
        </p>

        <p>
        Here I will make one of each, side by side (look at the HTML source!):
        <div>
            <canvas id="canvas1" width="150px" height="100px" style="border:2px solid #F00"></canvas>
            <svg id="svg1" width="150px" height="100px" style="border:2px solid #F00"></svg>
        </div>
        Note that these are normal HTML elements. We can give them ids (and classes),
        as well as styling them (here I gave them red borders).
        In fact, we can use CSS to style them - if you look at the style sheet for this workbook
        <code>a02.css</code>, you will see that I am styling all of the other ones
        on this page to have a thin black border.
        </p>
        <p>
            By themselves, these elements are pretty boring - we need to write some
            JavaScript to make them more interesting.
            (SVGs will have an alternative, but we'll get to that later)
        </p>
        <p>
          It may not be obvious in these examples, but in both SVG and Canvas,
          Y is measured downwards - this is different than you might be
          used to. We'll come back to talk about this later.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id2="box2" class="examplebox">
        <h2>Box 2: Drawing 2 ways</h2>
        <p>
            Now I am going to use those same boxes, but draw in them.
            The HTML is basically the same as box 1 (except that the style comes from CSS).
            The difference is that the JavaScript is going to add a rectangle to each.
            Be sure to go look at the JavaScript in A02_p1.js (which gets loaded at the end).
        </p>
        <div>
            <canvas id="canvas2" width="150px" height="100px" ></canvas>
            <svg id="svg2" width="150px" height="100px" ></svg>
        </div>
        <p>
            Understanding the details of how each of those works we can do later,
            but observe the key difference (when you look at the code).
            In Canvas, we use the "fill" command to fill in the pixels of the
            rectangle, while in SVG we create a "rect" element and add it to
            the SVG element.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this simple example, things don't seem too different.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="box3" class="examplebox">
        <h2>Box 3: Moving Squares</h2>
        <p>
            Now, let's animate those squares. This is very similar to box 2, except
            that we'll create an animation loop to move the squares.
        </p>
        <div>
                <canvas id="canvas3" width="150px" height="100px" ></canvas>
                <svg id="svg3" width="150px" height="100px" ></svg>
        </div>
        <p>
            Have a look at the JavaScript for this box, especially the <code>onTick</code>
            function that moves things (remember animation loops from Workbook 1?).
        </p>
        <p>
            This example hopefully highlights the difference between the <em>immediate</em> mode
            API (Canvas) and the <em>retained</em> mode API (SVG).
            In retained mode, the primitives (in this case the square) are
            represented as data. To move them, we change the data structure.
            In immediate mode, the primitives are drawn - they are only represented
            in the code. To animate things, we need to erase the picture and re-draw
            the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some ways, immediate mode is easier: we draw what we want, when we
            want. We can use whatever data structures we want to represent things.
            In other ways, retained mode is easier: we can created objects, and then
            alter them as needed.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="box4" class="examplebox">
        <H2>Box 4: Understanding SVG</H2>
        <p>
            The basic idea of SVG in the web browser is that each graphics object
            (like the square) is an HTML element in the DOM - just the same as
            anything else (paragraphs, buttons, scripts, ...).
            Adding the rectangle to the SVG element is just like adding a button
            to a paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the graphics elements are just like any other HTML element, we
            can do the same basic things: assign them an id, give them classes,
            use style sheets, etc. We can even create them right in the html using
            tags. They generate events just like many other kinds of HTML elements.
            Try moving the mouse over the rectangles on the right. Then
            look into the JavaScript to see that this works just like any other event.
            Also notice that the classes (where the colors come from) are defined
            in <code>a02.css</code>.
            <div>
                <svg width="150px" height="100px" style="border:1px solid #000">
                        <rect id="svgrect1" x="30" y="30" width="30" height="30" style="fill:#F00"></rect>
                        <rect id="svgrect2" x="90" y="50" width="30" height="30" class="lightbluewithborder"></rect>
                    </svg>
                <svg width="150px" height="100px" style="border:1px solid #000">

<h2>Summary: Two APIs</h2>
<p>On this page, you got to see two different ways to do graphics
on web pages. One using Canvas (an immediate mode API), and the
other using SVG (a retained mode API).</p>
<p>We'll learn to draw something more interesting than a rectangle
using Canvas in the next pages.</p>
<p>However, in order to learn more about SVG, you need to look at
other tutorials. You can start with the tutorials from
CS559 in 2014 (these are the first two, there will be more for concepts
in the coming weeks):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/cs559-fall2014/2014/08/30/getting-started-with-svg/">Tutorial:SVG:1 getting started</a></li>
<li><a href="http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/cs559-fall2014/2014/09/04/svg2-coordinate-systems/">Tutorial:SVG:2 coordinates</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It seems like in modern browsers, you don't need to use the namespace in html.
We do use it in the code (see the <code>createElementNS</code> usage in boxes above).</p>
<p>We will go on to talk more about Canvas on the <a href="A02_p2.html">next page</a>. </p>
