These may be used in figuring out what you've done, and helping you figure out if you understand things. They are not graded themselves.

## Question 1: In the exercise on page 2, what material property did you change with a map? How can the viewer tell that it's changed? What should we be looking for?

## Question 2: For your bump map example (page 3) ... How could the viewer tell that this is just a bump map, and not a displacement map?

## Question 3: For your normal map example (page 3) ... How did you figure out what directions the different map colors correspond to?

## Question 4: With a SkyBox (page 4), there are 3 things we mentioned that a "real" skybox has, but a fake skybox does not. How could you tell?

## Question 5: For your Environment Map (Reflection Map) example, why is the object you chose appropriate? (in class we discussed when Environment mapping works well, and doesn't)

## Question 6: To get full credit for this assignment, your textures need to include (1) a texture you made yourself, (2) a texture you got from the web, and (3) a texture that is a photograph of a real object. Tell us which ones you actually did in this assignment.
