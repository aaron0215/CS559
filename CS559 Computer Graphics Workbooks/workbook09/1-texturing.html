<div class="examplebox">
<p>There are three categories of things we need to think about:</p>
<ol>
<li>The "science" - how do the methods work?</li>
<li>The "engineering" - how do we use the methods in practice? (specifically, in a practical API)</li>
<li>The "art" - how do we use these to create interesting effects?</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1 (the science), we'll discuss how the methods work in theory in class, as well as the required readings. Make sure you understand it.</p>
<p>For 2 (the engineering), you'll need to see how THREE exposes the functionality - mainly by reading the THREE documentation, looking for samples on the web, and trying it out yourself. We'll see more of what is going on "under the hood" later when we start to program our own shaders.</p>
<p>For 3 (the art), you'll need to try it out to try to make cool looking stuff. Look for examples on the web to inspire you. Try basic things first, and then try to get better looking things. You'll have more opportunities to make interesting appearances in later workbooks (especially workbooks 11 and 12).</p>
<p>The exercises in this workbook ask you to try out the features in THREE for fancy texture mapping. We would like you do try to make interesting things to explore what the different types of textures do, but the requirements are pretty minimal for each of the exercises.</p>

<p>The first thing we'll try is material property maps on the <a href="2-materials.html">next page</a>.</p>
