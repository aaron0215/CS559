<p>Your turn.</p>
<p>In the world below (file <code>2-mesh.js</code>) make three objects and place them into the world so all can be seen.</p>
<p>They can be anything. They just must have 3 or more triangles, and you have to make each one from a <code>Geometry</code> and put them into the 559 Framework. You can even use the objects from later parts of the assignments (Pages 6,7) if they fullfill the requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li>One object must have face coloring where we can see triangles with different colors.</li>
<li>One object must have vertex coloring where we can see the colors smoothly varying across a triangle boundary.</li>
<li>One object must have vertex normals set so the lighting is smooth across a triangle boundary.</li>
</ol>
<p>You could take the right two objects from page 1 box 3, and the right object from page 1 box 4 to fill these requirements. Except that you need to have at least 3 triangles in each object, and simply copying my code may not be as good of a learning experience as really trying it yourself.</p>
<p>The other requirement is that it should be visibly obvious which object fills which requirement. (the smooth normals might require rotating it to see).</p>
<p>This page is meant to be practice for the bigger exercises on pages 5, 6 and 7.</p>
<p>After you've done it, go on to <a href="3-textures.html">Page 3</a></p>
