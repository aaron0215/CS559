<p>I have decided not to ask you to implement Bezier curve splitting. There are enough other programming tasks in this workbook.</p>
<p>But make sure you understand how to do it. There will be a question about it, and it will probably happen on the exam.</p>
<p>You can go on to the programming exercises on <a href="8-shape.html">Page 8</a>.</p>
