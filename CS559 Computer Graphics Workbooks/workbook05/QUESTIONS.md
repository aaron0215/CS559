# Questions for Workbook 5

## Q1: Which of the Curves in Box 1 and 2 on Page 1 (they are the same curves) have arc-length parameterization? (there are 8 curves - the right most one (the discontinuous line) does not have an arc-length parameterization because of its discontinuity in position).

## Q2: In Box 1 and 2 of Page 1, Curve 8 is not C(0), and Curve 7 (the V) is not C(1). Are there any other curves (among the first 6) that are not C(1)?

## Q3: For all the curves that are C(1) in Q2, which ones are C(2) (and which ones are not)?

## Q4: A Hermite cubic segments has its control points (p0, p0', p1, p1' using the notation of Page 3) as (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). What is this curve's value (x,y) at u=.5? (note: we can't ask you to turn in a sketch, but you should be able to sketch the curve)

## Q5: For the Hermite segment in Q4, what is it's tangent vector at u=1?

## Q6: A cubic Bezier curve has it's control points as (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0). A second cubic Bezier curve connects to this curve with C(1) continuity. What the positions of the first two control points of this second curve?

## Q7: In problem 6, a third cubic Bezier segment is added with C(1) continuity with the second segment. The third curve's control points are (2,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,1). What are the last two control points of the second curve (in order to make it have c(1) continuity).

## Q8: A Quadratic Bezier Curve has control points (0,0), (3,0), (3,3). A Cubic Bezier curve is connected to the end (u=1) of it with C(1) continuity. What are the positions of its first two control points? (Note: we are connecting a Quadratic to a Cubic)

## Q9: For a Quadratic Bezier Curve with control points (0,0), (3,0), (3,3), what is its tangent vector at u=.5?
